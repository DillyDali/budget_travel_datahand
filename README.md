# Charybdis Mini ZMK Configuration

My Charybdis Mini ZMK build using nice!nano's and a PMW 3610 trackball sensor. Features auto-mouse activation with an idle time requirement prior to activation to prevent accidental mouse clicks if the trackball is touched while typing. Includes a highly specific FUN layer which contains hotkeys for two forms of MacOS screenshots and controls for the window sizing and panelling app Rectangle.
